# fitnessnotes
An app to write notes at the gym

A simple / incomplete fitness application using express and react.
Built out this API back when I didn't really know what I was doing.

My first attempt at a SAAS application. 

This project utilizes MaterialUI and Redux for global state management (I very much prefer the context API now-a-days)
